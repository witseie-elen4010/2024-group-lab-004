All team members are present and ready for the meeting.

## Successes of Sprint 4

- **Rudolph:** Praised the team for completing all functionalities and adding extra features that significantly improved user experience.
- **Brent:** Commended the group's hard work and mutual support, noting that everyone contributed valuable input.
- **Chris:** Highlighted that user stories were completed early, which allowed ample time for bug fixing and testing.

## Failures of Sprint 4

- **Rudolph:** Pointed out that testing was challenging, with flaky tests in Playwright causing delays.
- **Sam:** Noted that the extensive use of the DOM in many functions made Jest testing particularly difficult.
- **Chris:** Mentioned that there were instances where pull requests were on hold due to issues with Playwright tests.
- **Brent:** Agreed that testing complexities led to some delays in the development process.
- **Rudolph:** Mentioned that doing logic tests throughout the process and end-to-end tests only after would have been more efficient and ensured that tests were in a better place consistently.

## Sprint Velocity

- 10 user stories were completed, totaling 19 story points.
- This was the highest sprint velocity achieved, as planned. The final sprint involved more work, and the team successfully managed the higher workload.
- Overall, the time planning and execution of the project were very good, achieving the desired outcomes each week.

## ADR

- No new ADR decisions were made this week.

- **Chris:** Mentioned that having never worked with web sockets before, this was a great learning experience.
- **Brent:** Added that creating an application with both a backend and frontend offered a chance to build good experience.
- **Sam:** Mentioned that using TBD and working in sprints offered good experience and practice for future jobs in software development.
- **Rudolph:** Noted that working as part of a bigger group was also useful for the working world.
