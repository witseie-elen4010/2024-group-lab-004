## In Attendance:

- Rudolph Torlage
- Brent Butkow
- Christopher Pearse
- Sam Cohen

## Welcome

All team members are present and ready for the meeting.

## Successes of Sprint 3

- **Rudolph:** Praised the team for successfully delivering the core functionalities of the game, enabling it to be played fully.
- **Sam:** Commended the team's productivity, stating that despite challenges, the group managed to achieve significant progress.
- **Chris:** Recognised the collaboration within the team.
- **Brent:** Noted that the group worked very hard together and managed to help each other understand different parts of the codebase, leading to high productivity.

## Failures of Sprint 3

- **Rudolph:** Highlighted time management as an issue, noting that other commitments resulted in delayed commits and pushes, causing most development work to be done at the end of the sprint.
- **Sam:** Pointed out that legacy bugs affected the new functionalities, requiring immediate attention to prevent further impact.
- **Chris:** Emphasised that insufficient testing was a problem due to architectural changes, which left a backlog of untested components.
- **Brent:** Stated that technical debt and unresolved issues from previous sprints are accumulating and starting to impact new developments.

## Areas for Improvement

- **Rudolph:** Suggested that the team should encourage working earlier in the sprint to avoid rushing through tasks at the last minute.
- **Chris:** Recommended allocating sufficient time to thoroughly test both existing and new features, especially after major architectural changes.
- **Brent:** Stressed the importance of proactively addressing potential problems to prevent issues from snowballing.

## Story Points

- 8 user stories were completed, totaling 16 story points.
- This maintains the current average of 16 story points and is 1 story point less than last week. The coming week is the final sprint. It is expected that the sprint velocity will be increased, as all remaining tasks need to be completed. This was expected ahead of time and it was decided that a sprint velocity of around 20 story points could be achieved for the final week.

## ADR

- **All Members:** Agreed on implementing mandatory user authentication, where a user must log in to access the landing page and can only proceed to the drawing page by creating or joining a game. This enhances the navigation flow and ensures better security.

## General

None.
