## Gameplay

Art Among Us, inspired by Gartic Phone and Among Us, aims to join the two to create a fun broken picture phone game, in which someone is trying to break the chain.

In a game, players will either play as an imposter or a crewmate. After entering a prompt, players must draw the prompt given to them, so that the next person can describe it. A crewmate must draw the prompt to the best of their ability, while the imposter wants to draw the prompt badly, so that the next player's description does not match the original prompt. However, do not be too explicit about your bad drawing, as the gameroom votes on the imposter at the end of the game. If the imposter is voted, the crewmates get points, and if not, the imposter gets points.

Players can play with their friends or with strangers, to draw anything that their mind can imagine! Make sure to have fun playing the game!
