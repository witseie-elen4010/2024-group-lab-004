Art Among Us is inspired by Gartic Phone and Among Us and aims to join the two to create a fun broken picture phone game, in which someone is trying to break the chain. Players will either play as an imposter or a crewmate. An imposter attempts to break the chain and cause the other players to mess up their subsequent drawings or prompts without being voted as the imposter. At the end of each round, voting for an imposter takes place and points are awarded.

Have fun playing the game!
